## Engineering Culture

We believe in transparency about how we work. Here's how we think about building software:

**Our Principles:**

- **Write it down** — Documentation helps both humans and AI assistants work effectively
- **Think about your future self** — Maintainability matters more than cleverness
- **Prefer explicit over implicit** — Clarity in code, writing, and communication
- **Prototypes have special powers** — We move fast when exploring, with clear boundaries
